    %p
      This website is inspired by the 
      %a{href: "http://chess.emrald.net"} Chess Tactics Server.
      Instead of chess problems, here you answer questions about the rules of basketball, according to the official FIBA rules and interpretations 2014.

      On a wrong answer, the game stops by default and shows why the answer is
      what we think it is. References to the 
      %a{href: "http://www.fiba.com/asp_scripts/downMana.asp?fileID=4530"} rulebook 2014 (pdf)
      are included as R<em>n</em> where <em>n</em> is the article number.

    %h2 Rating
    %p
      Both players and questions are rated according to the
      %a{href: "http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html"} Glicko-2 rating system.
      Players and questions have a rating (starts at 1500) and rating deviation (starts at 350), which is a measure of the degree of confidence in your current rating. As you solve more and more problems your deviation decreases. When you have a large deviation your rating changes a lot each time that you solve a problem.
      When you fail to solve a question, the question "wins" the challenge with a 0-1 score.
      When you give the right answer, the points are awarded according to the time it took to answer the question.

    %h2 Time
    If you solve the question in less than #{@t0} seconds, you get the full 1-0 score. After #{@t0} seconds the score is linearly decreasing with 1/2-1/2 at #{@t1} seconds. After #{@t1} seconds, the decrease of the result is exponential with a 
    %a{href: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay#Mean_lifetime"} time constant
    of #{@tau} seconds.
